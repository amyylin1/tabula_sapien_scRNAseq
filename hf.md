Explain the following code

```python
sns.set_context("paper", font_scale=4, rc={"lines.linewidth":6})
hue = 'tissue'
kind = 'ecdf'
x = 'IR_VDJ_1_v_mu_freq'
sel = igh_filtered[hue].value_counts() > 2
data = igh_filtered[igh_filtered[hue].isin(sel[sel].index)]

g = sns.displot(data, y = data[x], kind=kind, hue=hue, palette=tissue_colors(), height=20, aspect=1.2)

g.set_axis_labels(y_var = 'V gene Mutation Frequency', x_var='Proportion of cells')
g.savefig('{}/{}_{}_{}.pdf'.format(output_dir, x, kind,hue))

```

This code is using the Python `seaborn` library to create a visualization of a dataset. Specifically, it's creating a distribution plot (`displot`) with the x-axis showing the proportion of cells and the y-axis showing the V gene mutation frequency.

The first line sets the context for the plot, making it look like it will be printed on paper, with a large font size and thick lines. 

The next four lines define variables for the `hue`, `kind`, `x`, and `sel` parameters. `hue` determines which column in the dataset will be used to color different parts of the plot. `kind` defines the type of plot that will be created - in this case, an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plot. `x` specifies which column in the dataset will be plotted on the y-axis. `sel` is a boolean expression that will be used to filter the dataset.

The next two lines select a subset of the dataset based on the value counts of the `hue` column. The resulting `data` variable will only contain rows where the value in the selected `hue` column appears more than twice.

Finally, the last three lines use `seaborn` to create and save the visualization as a PDF file. The `displot` function is passed the filtered `data` variable and several other parameters, including the `hue` variable for coloring, and a custom `palette` of colors for different values of `tissue`. The resulting plot is saved to a file with a name based on the `output_dir`, `x`, `kind`, and `hue` variables.

Explain the following code

```python
cell_label = 'cell_ontology_class'
bcell_filter = 'b cell|plasma cell'
hue = cell_label
kind = 'ecdf'
mu_freq = 'v_mu_freq'
sel = igh_filtered[hue].value_counts() > 5
data = igh_filtered[igh_filtered[hue].isin(sel[sel].index)]
data = data[data[cell_label].str.contains(bcell_filter)]
g = sns.displot(data, y = data[x], kind=kind, hue=hue, height=20, aspect=1.2)

g.savefig('{}/{}_{}_{}.pdf'.format(output_dir, x, kind,hue))
g.set_axis_labels(y_var = 'V gene Mutation Frequency', x_var='Proportion of cells')
```

This Python code is using the `seaborn` library to create a visualization of a dataset. 

The first two variables, `cell_label` and `bcell_filter`, specify the name of the column containing cell types (e.g., B cells) and a regular expression used to filter the cell types of interest. 

The next three variables are similar to those in the previous example. `hue` determines which column in the dataset will be used to color different parts of the plot. `kind` defines the type of plot that will be created - in this case, another empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plot. `mu_freq` specifies which column in the dataset will be plotted on the y-axis.

The next line selects a subset of the dataset based on the value counts of the `hue` column. The resulting `data` variable will only contain rows where the value in the selected `hue` column appears more than five times.

The next line further filters `data` by selecting only rows where the `cell_ontology_class` column contains either "b cell" or "plasma cell".

Finally, `seaborn` is used to create and save the visualization as a PDF file, just like in the previous example. The `displot` function is passed the filtered `data` variable and several other parameters, including the `hue` variable for coloring. The resulting plot is saved to a file with a name based on the `output_dir`, `x`, `kind`, and `hue` variables.
